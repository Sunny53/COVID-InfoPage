        <p>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. 
            Learn how COVID 19 spreads and practice actions to help prevent the spread.
        </p>
        <ul class="safety-list"><p><b>To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, everyone should:</b></p>
            <li>Clean your hands often(soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
            <li>Avoid close contact with those that are sick</li>
            <li>Keep at least 6 feet distance between others</li>
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask</li>
            <li>Cover sneeze/cough with tissue, then throw away the tissue</li>
            <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects/surfaces</li>
            <li>Monitor yourself for symptoms</li>

            <p><b>To find a COVID-19 Vaccine near you, visit <a target="blank" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/">vaccines.org</a>.</b> 
            The three approved vaccines are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen. Pfizer and Moderna
            are two shots while Johnson & Johnson requires only one shot. One is considered fully vaccinated two weeks 
            after the last shot. For more information visit <a target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov">cdc.org.</a></p><br>
            <p>Different Vaccines work in different ways. All of them leave the body with a supply of "memory" T-lymphocytes
            and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus in the future. It usually takes a few weeks after vaccination
            for a vaccine to take effect. Sometimes, during the process of building immunity, symptoms such as a fever can occur.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are both mRNA vaccines.</b> They contain a little bit of the COVID-19 virus that gives our
            cell a blueprint to make a protein that's unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy
            the bit of virus. Our bodies recognize the alien protein, and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes to fight the virus.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Johnson & Johnson's Janssen is a vector vaccine.</b> It contains a modified version of a different virus from the COIVD-19 virus.
            Inside the shell of the modified virus, there's material from the COVID-19 virus. This is what's called a "viral vector."
            Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that's unique to the
            COVID-19 virus. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and
            B-lymphocytes that'll remember how to fight the Covid-19 virus.
